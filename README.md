# ssj React Project Template Guide

__________________

### Summary

This `React` project template features a few key package integrations/settings I've found I need in 
every
`React` project. These are

- absolute import paths
- `eslint` and some plugins
- `husky`
- `lint-staged`
- `prettier`
- `react-router`
- `storybook`
- `styled-components`

### Checklist
Make sure that you 
1. Edit the `public/index.html` file to meet your needs.
2. Edit the `package.json` file to properly reflect the author, package name, version number, etc.
